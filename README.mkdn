Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android/PsychoOS, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](https://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the PsychoOS trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/PsychoOS/manifest.git -b Psycho-N

Then to sync up:

    repo sync
